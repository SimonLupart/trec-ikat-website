Furthermore, the recent announcement of assistant-enabled smart glasses from leading tech companies continues this trend towards real-world interaction. However, despite current assistants' ability to perform well-defined simple actions, their ability to support information seeking in conversations continues to be limited.</p> <p>Conversational Information Seeking (CIS) is an established and important research direction. It is of interest to the broad research community within information retrieval, such as ranking, summarizing and question answering (QA), as well as for natural language processing and dialogue systems communities.</p> <p>The TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT) builds on the experience of four successful years of TREC Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT), where the key focus of iKAT is on researching and developing collaborative information seeking conversational agents which can tailor and personalize their response based on what they learn about and from the user.</p> <p>The fourth year of CAsT aimed to add more conversational elements to the interaction streams, by introducing mixed initiatives (clarifications, and suggestions) to create multi-path, multi-turn conversations for each topic. TREC iKAT evolves CAsT into a new track to signal this new trajectory. iKAT aims to focus on supporting multi-path, multi-turn, multi-perspective conversations, i.e., for a given topic, the direction and the conversation that evolves depends not only on the prior responses but also on the user (and their background/perspective/context/etc). As different personas undertake various topics, systems need to build and develop a picture of who the user is, in order to best address their information needs. Put another way, iKAT focuses on system understanding of user knowledge and information needs in accordance to the available context.</p> <p>Shield: </p> <p>All data associated with this work is licensed and released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#track-coordinators","title":"Track Coordinators","text":"<p>Mohammad Aliannejadi, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
